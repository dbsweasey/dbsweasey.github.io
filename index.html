  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <h2>I am David Sweasey</h2>
  <br />
  <img class src="picofme.jpg" alt="Picture of David" />
  <p id="bio"> I am a junior in computer science studying at NC State. I have a strong passion for
    programming, software
    development, artificial
    intelligence, and computer science in general. I plan to complete the artifical intelligence concentration
    offered
    at NC State then t
    attend grad school to develop a robust understanding of machine learning. My passion stems from my keen childhood
    interest in medicine. I have always had a deisre to help people. Within the realm of computer science, I believe
    machine learning goes hand in hand with medicine. Fields such as computational biology allow machine learning to
    analyze the human genome, protein synthesis, and various other biological topics. With modern computational power
    and a robust understanding of biological processess, machine learning has the capability of preventing diseases
    before they occur, healing people suffering ailment, and generally improving humanities well-being.
