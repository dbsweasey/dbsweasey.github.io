  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div id="bio">
    <p> I am a senior in computer science studying at NC State. I have a strong passion for
      programming, software
      development, artificial
      intelligence, and computer science in general. I am completing the artificial intelligence concentration
      offered
      at NC State. I then plan to work for a year to get some real-world experience before
      attending graduate school to develop a robust understanding of machine learning.</p>
    <br />
    <p> My passion stems from my keen childhood
      interest in medicine. I have always had a deisre to help people. Within the realm of computer science, I believe
      machine learning goes hand in hand with medicine. Fields such as computational biology allow machine learning to
      analyze the human genome, protein synthesis, and various other biological topics. With modern computational power
      and a robust understanding of biological processess, machine learning has the capability of preventing diseases
      before they occur, healing people suffering ailment, and generally improving humanities well-being.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p> I hope to to work in research or developmental fields relating to this realm of machine learning. I am currently
      seeking
      a full-time position for the Summer of '25. Please explore my website and reach out with
      any questions, comments, or concerns.
