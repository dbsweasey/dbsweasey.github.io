        projects.
        I have provided a GitHub link if you would like to explore further. Do not hesitate
        to reach out with further questions. These have been completed in several
        languages,
        including Java, C, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

                <p>An encryption and decryption software created in C. The AES algorithm is used to encrypt plaintext
                    using a provided
                    16 character key, or decrypt ciphertext via the same key. It was built in Linux (WSL) and runs in
                    Linux via the command line.
                    See usage and installation details on Github.

                    Javascript
                    on the back-end. The snake, a blue square, can be controlled using the arrow keys in order to
                    collect
                    food, the yellow blocks. As you collect food, the snake gets longer. Collect as much food as
                    possible whilst
                    avoiding collisions with the snake's body and the edges. </p>

                    Staff can add inventory, create, edit,
                    or delete coffee recipes. Users can order, pay for, and then pick up their coffee.
                    Staff can cancel or fulfil orders. This software incorporates the popular Java frameworks
                    Hibernate and Spring, and uses RestAPI with SQL for database manipulation. Boasts a strong
                    frontend implemented with AngularJS.

                <p>This is a brick-breaker game I built using Code.org in highschool as a part of a computer science
                    course. It was made in Javascript, and uses the built in Code.org elements of HTML. Use arrow keys
                    to move the bouncer to keep the ball in play. I plan on creating a similar game using JScript, HTML,
                    and CSS from scratch.</p>
