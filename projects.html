    <p id="description"> Below are several of my completed and work-in-progress
        projects.
        Each contains a breif description, an image of the project in action, and a GitHub link to explore the projects
        further. These are made in several
        languages,
        including Java, C, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Hover over any of the images to zoom in and see it better.

                <p>An encryption and decryption software created in C. The AES algorithm is used to encrypt plaintext
                    using a provided
                    16 character key, or decrypt ciphertext via the same key. It was built in Linux (WSL) and runs in
                    Linux via the command line.
                    See usage and installation details on Github.

                    Javascript
                    on the back-end. The snake, a blue square, can be controlled using the arrow keys in order to
                    collect
                    food, the yellow blocks. As you collect food, the snake gets longer. Collect as much food as
                    possible whilst
                    avoiding collisions with the snake's body and the edges. </p>

                <p>This is a brick-breaker game I built using Code.org in highschool as a part of a computer science
                    course. It was made in Javascript, and uses the built in Code.org elements of HTML. Use arrow keys
                    to move the bouncer to keep the ball in play. I plan on creating a similar game using JScript, HTML,
                    and CSS from scratch.</p>
